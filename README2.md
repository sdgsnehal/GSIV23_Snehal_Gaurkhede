### elements from the challenge that i did well
Responsive Design Implementation: I have implemented responsive design using Material-UI's responsive sx prop  These examples cover various screen sizes and breakpoints (xs, sm, md, etc.), showcasing the ability to create layouts that adapt to different devices.

Component Structuring and Composition: I used structure components effectively to maintain clean and organized code. This includes creating separate components for Movie Cards, Movies, and Detail Pages. By demonstrating proper component composition and separation of concerns, I showcased proficiency in structuring code for maintainability.

URL Parameter Handling: I provided guidance on how to handle URL parameters using react-router and utilize them to fetch and display specific movie details. This demonstrates my understanding of routing and dynamic data handling in React applications.

### improvement in solution
Error Handling and Loading States: Implement proper error handling for API requests and loading states. Display meaningful error messages when API calls fail, and show loading indicators during data fetching to enhance user experience and provide feedback.

Detail Page Enhancement: Improve the Movie Detail Page by adding additional information, such as genres, production companies, and more cast/crew details. Consider using accordions or tabs to organize this information effectively.
